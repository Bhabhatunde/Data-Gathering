# Capstone Project on Machine Learning Prediction
This project involves analyzing SpaceX's rocket launches to predict the likelihood of reusing the first stage of their Falcon 9 rockets, thereby estimating the cost of launches. The focus is on understanding the factors influencing the success of the first stage landing and using this information to train a machine learning model for prediction.
Historical data on SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches was collected from public databases, official websites, and spaceflight tracking services. This included information on payload weight, orbit type, launch site, weather conditions, and mission parameters.
